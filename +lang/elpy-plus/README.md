## Elpy-plus

This implementation is largely adapted from Rainer Gemulla's version, see the original (now deprecated) version [here](https://github.com/rgemulla/spacemacs-layers/tree/master/%2Blang/elpy).

The differences include removal of (now) boilerplate code, removal of company autocompletions based on delays and changing the `company-complete` keybinding to `M-<tab>`.
